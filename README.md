# My React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it. The page will reload when you make changes, and lint errors will appear in the console.
- **`npm test`**: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) guide for more details.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for performance, minifies the files, and includes hashes in filenames. See the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.
- **`npm run eject`**: **Note: This is a one-way operation!** Ejects the app to customize build tools and configurations. After ejecting, you can’t go back. For more details, see the [eject guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject).
